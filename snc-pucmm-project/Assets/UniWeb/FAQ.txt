FAQ 1: CROSSDOMAIN.XML AND WEB PLAYER PROBLEMS?
-----------------------------------------------
NB: To use UniWeb in the Web Player, you must have a server running on
the host which supplies a crossdomain.xml file. See: http://bit.ly/h6QY0M


FAQ 2: How do I enable Charles / Fiddler proxy debugging?
---------------------------------------------------------
If the proxy is not automatically picked up by .NET (a common issue), you can
force the proxy to be used by setting:

    HTTP.Request.proxy = new Uri("http://127.0.0.1:8888");

before you make a request.


FAQ 3: How do I do a GET/PUT/POST/DELETE/HEAD request?
------------------------------------------------------
Just change the first argument of the request constructor, eg:

var request = new HTTP.Request("HEAD", url);


FAQ 4: What do I do with the UniWeb*.dll.tgz files?
---------------------------------------------------
These are compiled versions of UniWeb which you can use instead of importing
the entire source tree. The UniWeb-WP8.dll.tgz file contains a DLL that will 
work with Windown Phone 8.
